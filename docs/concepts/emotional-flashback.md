# Emotional Flashbacks

[The Awareness Center](https://theawarenesscentre.com/emotional-flashbacks/):

> An emotional flashback can be triggered by a situation, a circumstance or an event that reminds you exactly what happened to you in childhood. You can feel transported back to those feelings of helplessness and despair, with no safe parental figure around to make it all better.

Pete Walker, Complex PTSD, From Surviving to Thriving:

> Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions (‘amygdala hijackings’) to the frightening circumstances of childhood. They are typically experienced as intense and confusing episodes of fear and/or despair – or as sorrowful and/or enraged reactions to this fear and despair.
