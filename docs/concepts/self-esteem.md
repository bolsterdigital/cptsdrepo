# Self-esteem

As we strive to gain a better understanding of how we see ourselves, it is important to understand the difference between a number of related concepts, such as self-esteem, self-image, self-concept and self-confidence.

> Our self-concept, or self-image, is the set of beliefs or images we have about ourselves. Our self-esteem is the measure of how much we like and approve of our self-concept. Another way of thinking about it is that self-esteem is how much respect you have for yourself, while self-image is how you see yourself.

[The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Pillars-Self-Esteem-Definitive-Leading/dp/0553374397) explains why low self-esteem is not just a problem in and of itself, but often an impediment to recovery, as having a low self-esteem reinforces our [4F responses](/concepts/4f-responses):

> What self-esteem affects is our emotional incentives. Our feelings tend to encourage or discourage thinking, to draw us toward facts, truth, and reality, or away from them—toward efficacy or away from it. That is why the first steps of building self-esteem can be difficult: We are challenged to raise the level of our consciousness in the face of emotional resistance. We need to challenge the belief that our interests are best served by blindness.

Our innate sense of worthlessness, our habit of self-abandonment all but ensures we dare not face reality – we feel as if we are unable and unworthy to do so. Whether we fight, flee, freeze or fawn, our low self-esteem self-perpetuates:

> The danger is that we will become the prisoners of our negative self-image. We allow it to dictate our actions. We define ourselves as mediocre or weak or cowardly or ineffectual and our performance reflects this definition.

And:

> We submit to feelings of psychological determinism. We tell ourselves we are powerless. We are rewarded for doing so, in that we do not have to take risks or awaken from our passivity.

And:

> The base and motor of poor self-esteem is not confidence but fear. Not to live, but to escape the terror of life, is the fundamental goal.

Nurturing our self-esteem, therefore, is essential if we are to recover from CPTSD. This can be done by learning to disidentify from the [Inner Critic](/concepts/inner-critic) by thought-stopping and thought-correcting, called _shrinking the critic_, as a part of our [Cognitive Healing](/recovery-process/1-cognitive-healing) process:

> Cognitive healing also depends on learning to choose healthy and more accurate ways of talking to and thinking about yourself. On the broadest level, this involves upgrading the story you tell yourself about your pain. [...] This work then requires us to build a fierce allegiance to ourselves. Such loyalty strengthens us for the cognitive work of freeing our brains from being conditioned to attack so many normal parts of our selves. Cognitive work is fundamental to helping you disidentify from the self-hating critic with which your parents inculcated you.
