# Toxic Shame

Shame, or *toxic shame*, is an important concept in CPTSD. This page will help clarify what shame is, partly by contrasting it to related concepts.

Toxic shame serves to perpetuate low self-esteem and self-abandonment. It is a result from overly identifying with your [inner critic](/concepts/inner-critic).

## Shame vs. blame

Pete Walker states, in *‌Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving*: "Shame is blame unfairly turned against the self”. Toxic shame "obliterates a Cptsd survivor’s self-esteem with an overwhelming sense that he is loathsome, ugly, stupid, or fatally flawed". 


> You can redirect the anger of the critic’s blaming messages away from you. You can direct the anger onto the installers of the critic, or sideways onto the critic itself. 

And:

> Toxic shame can obliterate your self-esteem in the blink of an eye. In an emotional flashback you can regress instantly into feeling and thinking that you are as worthless and contemptible as your family perceived you. When you are stranded in a flashback, toxic shame devolves into the intensely painful alienation of the abandonment mélange - a roiling morass of shame, fear and depression.

## Shame vs. guilt

Beverly Engel writes:

> Shame is often confused with guilt, but it is not the same emotion. When we feel guilt, we feel badly about something we did or neglected to do. When we feel shame, we feel badly about who we are. 

And:

> “Another distinction between guilt and shame is that shame comes from public exposure to one’s own vulnerability, while guilt is private. ”

## Externalized shame
The externalization of shame is related to the concept of the [outer critic](/concepts/outer-critic). 

> Some people defend against shame by projecting it on others and by raging at them. If you tend to do this, particularly if you lash out at people or have sudden, unexpected fits of rage, pay attention to the ways in which you convert shame into anger.
