## Listening

> Focusing is being a good listener to your inner self. There are parts of you that want to be heard, without judgment, without criticism, without advice. In Focusing, you can give yourself that non-judgmental listening that feels good and brings greater clarity. The qualities of good listening are:
>
> - A welcoming presence
> - Holding the space
> - Hearing the essence
> - Staying in present time.

## Being a friend

> Focusing is like being a friend to your own inner experience. The qualities of true friendship include acknowledging, allowing, patience, curiosity, respect, warmth, welcome, empathy, compassion, and love. If you don't feel you can be that much of a friend to yourself immediately, don't worry—you'll be able to build up to it, step by step. And the first step is as simple as saying hello.

> When you notice you're having a feeling, say to the feeling, Hello. I know you're there.

## Steps of focusing

> 1. **Get comfortable**. Notice how your feet feel, how your hands feel, how your shoulders feel. Take time to be aware of yourself as a physical being, taking up space in the world, having weight and volume and substance. After you feel that your awareness is in your body, bring your awareness into the middle area of your body, the part that includes your throat, chest, stomach, and abdomen. Take time to sense in your throat the same way you would check if you have a sore throat. Then bring awareness down inside your chest area. Be aware of anything, such as tightness, heaviness, constriction, expansion, blank-ness, or peacefulness. Then bring your awareness down into your stomach and abdomen area.
> 2. **Which way today**? “Imagine you are sending a welcoming invitation to your inner self. Say to yourself, in the middle of your body, What wants my awareness now? or How am I about that issue?
> 3. **I'm sensing into my body.**. Now take time to notice how you are feeling in your body. You might notice sensations, emotions, or a kind of overall mood or atmosphere. There may be something already there when you bring awareness into your body or, in response to your invitation, you may feel something beginning to form. Give it time
> 4. **What wants my awareness now? or How am I about that issue?** When you are starting to become aware of something, and starting to sense where it is in your body, take time to notice what this something is like. What you notice might be unclear, slight, subtle, or vague, or it might be very strong and definite. Sense anything: an emotion like sad or scared, a sensation like tight or jittery, an image like a knot or a rock—anything at all.
> 5. **I'm saying hello to what's here.**. When you first become aware of something, say to it, Hello. I know you're there. Then take some time to notice how it responds to your greeting. It might ease a bit, or settle like a bird on a branch, or feel like someone getting comfortable to start a conversation, or it might get clearer and stronger, as if coming into focus.
> 6. **I'm finding the best way to describe it.** After you say hello to your felt sense, the next step is to describe it. Simply say to yourself how the sense feels right now in your body.
> 7. **Checking back with your body** is more than a stage in the Focusing process. It is something you do over and over, all through the session. At this point, when you're finding the description, do it first. But then please continue.”
> 8. Check if the description fits. If it is 'squeezing', ask Is it squeezing?It could be something else, or something in addition to squeezing.
> 9. Ask if you can sit with the feeling.
> 10. Notice if other sensations with descriptions come up.
> 11. Ask a question: does it have an emotional quality? If it is tightness, is it a scared tightness, an angry tightness? Ask: 'what gets it so...?', or 'what gets you the most...?', 'what is it connected to?', 'What does it need?', 'what are you afraid of?', 'What needs to happen next?' And ask your body: 'How would "all OK" feel?' or 'What do you want me to know?
> 12. “Is it OK to stop in a minute or two, or is there something more you need to let me know first?" ”
> 13. R review what came and to ask yourself what you would like to remember from the session.”

Focusing begins with bringing awareness into the body, especially the throat, chest, stomach, and abdomen.
we invite something to be felt by asking a gentle, open question such as What wants my awareness now?

When we first find a feeling, we acknowledge it by saying an inner hello to it, and then we describe or name it.

In the next stage of Focusing, we sit down with the feeling to get to know it better, with an attitude of interested curiosity.

We take time to allow a little more meaning to come from the feeling, perhaps a word for an emotional quality. Then we check the word with the feeling, to make sure it feels right.

We are not in a hurry. We create an inner atmosphere of no pressure, just being with what's there. We ask gentle questions as a way of inviting the feeling to tell us more.

In Focusing, change comes in steps, small (usually) realizations, each one of which feels right and makes some difference in the body.

The meaning that is carried in the body is sometimes connected with a memory, a belief or attitude, or an unmet need or an unexpressed part of ourselves. There is no need to fix or solve the problem. Acknowledging the message, really hearing it, is all that is needed to bring deep relief.

Ending a Focusing session happens slowly and respectfully. We may want to stay for a while with good feelings. We thank the body, and say we'll be back.
