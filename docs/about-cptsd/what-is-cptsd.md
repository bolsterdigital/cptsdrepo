# What is CPTSD?

Well, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder):

> Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex trauma disorder)[1] is a psychological disorder that can develop in response to prolonged, repeated experience of interpersonal trauma in a context in which the individual perceives little or no chance of escape

The definition by Pete Walker in [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](/resources/books#complex-ptsd-from-surviving-to-thriving):

> “Cptsd is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder. It is delineated from this better known trauma syndrome by five of its most common and troublesome features: emotional flashbacks, toxic shame, self-abandonment, a vicious inner critic and social anxiety.”
