# What is CPTSD?

Well, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder):

> Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex trauma disorder)[1] is a psychological disorder that can develop in response to prolonged, repeated experience of interpersonal trauma in a context in which the individual perceives little or no chance of escape

The definition by Pete Walker in [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](/resources/books#complex-ptsd-from-surviving-to-thriving):

> “Cptsd is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder. It is delineated from this better known trauma syndrome by five of its most common and troublesome features: emotional flashbacks, toxic shame, self-abandonment, a vicious inner critic and social anxiety.”

## Understanding your symptoms as survival mechanisms

An important aspect of the way Complex PTSD is conceptualized is that it understands various symptoms as originating from stress responses that once served a purpose, but have simply continued to control your mental life, even though their expiration dates have expired, as they no longer serve their purpose.

This insight often immediately ameliorates a lot of the additional shame that survivors feel about their condition. Their symptoms prove that their brains did _a very good job_ of helping them through some difficult times with some very powerful trauma responses – so powerful, in fact, that it regrettably leads to various problems down the road.

As Bessel van der Kolk notes in [The Body Keeps the Score](/resources/books#the-body-keeps-the-score):

> The more neuroscience discovers about the brain, the more we realize that it is a vast network of interconnected parts organized to help us survive and flourish. Knowing how these parts work together is essential to understanding how trauma affects every part of the human organism and can serve as an indispensable guide to resolving traumatic stress.
