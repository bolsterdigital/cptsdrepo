# Introduction

In this section, a possible path for a recovery process is laid out. It relies heavily on the steps outlined in the book [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](/resources/books#complex-ptsd-from-surviving-to-thriving) by Pete Walker.

Note that recovery is often not a linear process. You will work on multiple areas simultaneously, and you will encounter setbacks.

:::caution

This recovery process are not a substitution for professional therapy by a licensed therapist.

## Signs of recovery

Pete Walker distinguishes several signs of recovery:

- **Fewer emotional flashbacks**" “Effective recovery work leads to an ongoing reduction of emotional flashbacks. Over time, with enough practice, you become more proficient at managing triggered states. This in turn results in flashbacks occurring less often, less intensely and less enduringly."
- **A shrunken inner critic**: "Another key sign of recovering is that your critic begins to shrink and lose its dominance over your psyche. As it shrinks, your user-friendly ego has room to grow and to develop the kind of mindfulness that recognizes when the critic has taken over. This in turn allows you to progressively reject the critic’s perfectionistic and drasticizing processes." 
- **A shrunken outer critic**: "Additionally, you perseverate less in disappointment about other people’s minor miscues."
- **Relaxation**: "A further sign of recovering is a gradual increase in your ability to relax. With this comes an increasing ability to resist overreacting from a triggered position. 
- **Normalization of 4F Responses** "This further allows you to use your fight, flight, freeze and fawn“instincts in healthy and non-self-destructive ways. This means you only fight back when under real attack, only flee when odds are insurmountable, only freeze when you need to go into acute ob“observation mode, and only fawn when it is appropriate to be self-sacrificing”
