# Introduction

In this section, a possible path for a recovery process is laid out. It relies heavily on the steps outlined in the book [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](/resources/books#complex-ptsd-from-surviving-to-thriving) by Pete Walker.

Notes:

- This recovery process are not a substitution for professional therapy by a licensed therapist.
- Recovery is often not a linear process. You will work on multiple areas simultaneously, and you will encounter setbacks.
