# 1. Cognitive healing

In this first phase:

- you learn what CPTSD is by becoming psychoeducated about CPTSD
- you gain an understanding how the way your parents or caregivers raised you resulted in the development of coping mechanisms
- you will then begin to reduce your feelings of shame, by redirecting anger towards your parents, or sideways toward your inner critic itself
- you will start to disidentify from your inner and outer critic

:::caution

It is important not to rush this step. As Pete Walker warns in his book _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_, prematurely utilizing mindfulness techniques or attempting to 'accept your critic' may lead to overwhelming emotional flashbacks. It is important to first learn how to _shrink the critic_.

## Shrinking the critic

One of the core problems of CPTSD is having a [low self-esteem](/concepts/self-esteem), which is continually re-inforced by the [Inner Critic](/concepts/inner-critic). See chapters 9 and 10 of [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](/resources/books#complex-ptsd-from-surviving-to-thriving) for extensive information on critic-shrinking.

> Nowhere is patience with ourselves more important than with the inner critic work. Typically the inner critic is too omnipresent to confront on every occasion. To do so would often leave no time for anything else.
> But when we practice critic-shrinking in a gradually increasing way over time, we can more consistently disidentify from its negative focus and switch to a more self-supportive perspective. Eventually a new positive habit of rescuing ourselves from shame and self-hate takes on its own life. I still have my unfair share of flashbacks, but rarely do I ever side with my toxic critic.
