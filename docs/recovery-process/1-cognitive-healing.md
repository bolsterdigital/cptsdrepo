# 1. Cognitive healing

In this first phase:

- you learn what CPTSD is by becoming psychoeducated about Cptsd
- you gain an understanding how the way your parents or caregivers raised you resulted in the development of coping mechanisms
- you will then begin to reduce your feelings of shame, by redirecting anger towards your caregivers
- you will start to disidentify from your inner and outer critic
