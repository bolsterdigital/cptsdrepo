# 1. Cognitive healing

In this first phase:

- you learn what CPTSD is by becoming psychoeducated about CPTSD
- you gain an understanding how the way your parents or caregivers raised you resulted in the development of coping mechanisms
- you will then begin to reduce your feelings of shame, by redirecting anger towards your parents, or sideways toward your inner critic itself
- you will start to disidentify from your inner and outer critic

:::caution

It is important not to rush this step. As Pete Walker warns in his book _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_, prematurely utilizing mindfulness techniques or attempting to 'accept your critic' may lead to overwhelming emotional flashbacks. It is important to first learn how to _shrink the critic_.
