# Intro

This website _might_ grow into a repository of knowledge on C-PTSD or Complex PTSD. This is still an early-stage effort. It is an open source project; feel free to [fork it on Github](https://github.com/bolsterdigital/cptsdrepo) and propose changes by submitting a pull request.

You do not need to have programming skills to use Github to contribute to an open source project. Read [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for more information.
